1)
Q. need to suspend nodes during compaction?
A. No. It's possible to compaction without any suspension.

2)
Q. Where is the roadmap of LeoFS?
A. http://www.leofs.org/docs/intro.html or https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/

3)
Q. LeoFS can change redundancy?
A. Yes, you can choice redundancy numbers. Please write to manager's system configuration.
http://www.leofs.org/docs/install.html#id3

4)
Q. How many time caching objects on gateway of LeoFS?
A. Default is 5 minutes.(0.12.5)

5)
Q. What is cache method of LeoFS?
A. You can choice 2 caching pattern on LeoFS. (0.12.5)
http://www.leofs.org/docs/install.html#leofs-gateway

6)
Q. How to update version of LeoFS?
A. Basically, rolling update. Detach 1 server, update, and attach again.

7)
Q. How many buckets can be in LeoFS?
A. We didn't prepare limits for that.

8)
Q. How to reflect new configuration file (app.config) to running LeoFS?
A. Configuration file can't change on current version.(0.12.5)

9)
Q. How to stop rebalance action of LeoFS?
A. It can't stop on current version.(0.12.5)

10)
Q. Which should we use IP or host(domain) name on configuration of LeoFS?
A. In LeoFS setting, you should write IP to configuration files.
In S3 clients setting file, you should write host name or domain because S3 specified it.
And if you run LeoFS with multiple nodes, do not use "127.0.0.1" on app.config and vm.args.

11)
A. What special characters can use in LeoFS as object names.
These following characters can not use to file name in LeoFS;
< > " { } | \ ^ [ ]`
These following characters have meaning in URL but it can use in LeoFS;
# % ; / ? : @ & = + $ ,
These following characters can use in LeoFS but do not recommend as URL;
â€˜ ( )

12)
Q. Bucket naming rule
A. http://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/s3_api.html#s3-path-label

13)
Q. How to change the speed of rebalance/recover. 
A. (Answer date: 2014/Jan/24th, target version: LeoFS 1.0.0-pre1)
Reference: http://www.leofs.org/docs/configuration.html#leofs-storage

Firstly, please change the number of *.num_of_batch_process.
In our environment, we change it to 1000, then rebalance time reduce 30%. But be careful to I/O and network usage!

#### THIS SAMPLE SETTING(START) ####

## --------------------------------------------------------------------
## STORAGE - MQ
## --------------------------------------------------------------------
## A number of mq-server's processes
mq.num_of_mq_procs = 8

## MQ recover per_object
mq.recover_per_object.num_of_batch_process = ${NUM_OF_PROC_PER_OBJECT}
mq.recover_per_object.interval_min = ${INT_PER_OBJECT_MIN}
mq.recover_per_object.interval_max = ${INT_PER_OBJECT_MAX}

## MQ synchronize objects by vnode-id
mq.sync_by_vnode_id.num_of_batch_process = ${NUM_OF_PROC_SYNC_BY_VN}
mq.sync_by_vnode_id.interval_min = ${INT_SYNC_BY_VNODE_MIN}
mq.sync_by_vnode_id.interval_max = ${INT_SYNC_BY_VNODE_MAX}

## MQ rebalance objects
mq.rebalance.num_of_batch_process = ${NUM_OF_PROC_REBALANCE}
mq.rebalance.interval_min = ${INT_REBALANCE_MIN}
mq.rebalance.interval_max = ${INT_REBALANCE_MAX}

## MQ delete objects
mq.delete_object.num_of_batch_process = ${NUM_OF_PROC_ASYNC_DEL}
mq.delete_object.interval_min = ${INT_ASYNC_DEL_MIN}
mq.delete_object.interval_max = ${INT_ASYNC_DEL_MAX}

## MQ recover a node's object
mq.recovery_node.num_of_batch_process = ${NUM_OF_PROC_RECOVERY_N}
mq.recovery_node.interval_min = ${INT_RECOVERY_NODE_MIN}
mq.recovery_node.interval_max = ${INT_RECOVERY_NODE_MAX}


## --------------------------------------------------------------------
## STORAGE - Replication/Recovery object(s)
## --------------------------------------------------------------------
## Rack-id for the rack-awareness replica placement
replication.rack_awareness.rack_id = []

## Size of stacked objects (bytes)
replication.recovery.size_of_stacked_objs = 67108864

## Stacking timeout (msec)
replication.recovery.stacking_timeout = 5000

#### THIS SAMPLE SETTING(END) ####

Flow of back-end data transferring for rebalance/recover

# Sense of configurations
	*.num_of_batch_process
		How many data will transfer at same time.Effect to #1 of above image.
	*.interval_min
		Minimum number of random sleep time.(millisecond) Effect to #2 of above image.
	*.interval_max
		Maximum number of random sleep time.(millisecond) Effect to #2 of above image.

14)
Q. Where is my data after add a new node?
A. Your data are distributed to some nodes.
"whereis" command will helpful to check the position of data.
