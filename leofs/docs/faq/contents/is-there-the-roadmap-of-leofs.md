We've published LeoFS milestones on both of [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-project/leofs#milestones) and [LeoFS website](http://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/intro.html#milestones). We may revise the milestones occasionally because there is a possibility to add new features or change priority of implementation. We'll keep them always updated.
