In order to reduce system resource usage for calculating the result of the du command,
LeoFS keep that information on memory and when stopping itself, LeoFS save those data into a local file. then when restarting, LeoFS load those on memory.

So if LeoFS is stopped unintentionally like killing by OOM killer, those data can become inconsistent with actual usage.

If you get into this situation, you can recover those data by issueing the compact-start command to the node. after finishing the compaction, the result of the du command will be consitent with actual usage.
