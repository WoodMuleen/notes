We've published LeoFS milestones on [Github](https://github.com/leo-project/leofs#milestones) and [LeoFS website](http://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/intro.html#milestones). We may revise the milestones occasionally because it is possible for us to add new features or change priority of implementation. We're going to keep to announce the new milestones after updated them.
